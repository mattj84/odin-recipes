<h2>Incredible, creamy ranch dressing</h2>
<p>This homemade ranch dressing is out of this world, and we guarantee you'll never settle for the shop bought version ever again!</p>
<p>We think it's perfect served alongside grilled or roasted meats and veggies, or simply as a dip.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>For this amazing ranch dressing, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-2 cups mayonnaise</li>
<li>1 cup sour cream</li>
<li>Fresh garlic - 1 glove, grated</li>
<li>Fresh dill, 1 Tbsp, finely chopped</li>
<li>The juice of 1 fresh lemon</li>
<li>1 tsp dried dill</li>
<li>1 tsp dried parsley</li>
<li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
<li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 pinch monosodium glutamate</li>
<li>Salt</li></ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream and lemon juice in a bowl and whisk thoroughly. If the mixture is too thick, add some water or milk and whisk until it reaches your desired thickness.</li>
    <li>Add the dried herbs, along with the cayenne pepper and stir in.</li>
    <li>Add a pinch of the monosodium glutamate, and season with salt and pepper. Adjust to taste.</li>
